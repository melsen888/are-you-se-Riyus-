The motivation behind creating "Are-you-se-Riyus-" stems from our frustration with increasingly difficult examination systems. As members of the Ep.OneQua***m class gang, we aimed to develop a tool that would make navigating the digital landscape more efficient and secure, especially in the context of exams. Our project reflects a blend of rebellion and innovation, with the goal of providing a superior browsing experience and supporting those who share our frustrations.
